          <h2>What?</h2>
          <p>The Functional Source License (FSL) is a source-available non-compete license that converts to Apache 2.0 or MIT after one year. It is designed for companies that want to make their core products <b>as Open Source as possible</b> without jeopardizing their business. FSL provides everything a developer needs to use and learn from your software.</p>

          <h2>FAQ</h2>

          <dl>
            <dt>Why?</dt>

            <dd>Open Source values are one-sided, focused exclusively on the
              rights of software users. Developer rights can also be worth
              protecting. Companies—especially SaaS companies—need a simple,
              widely recognized license that gets as close to Open Source as
              possible without jeopardizing their right to sustainably develop
              their software. Functional Source License (FSL) is designed to
              meet this need.</dd>

            <dt>Why not open core?</dt>
            <dd>Open core is not open enough.</dd>

            <dt>Why not copyleft?</dt>
            <dd>Copyleft is too restrictive.</dd>

            <dt>Why not [some other alternative]?</dt>

            <dd>There have been many attempts over the decades to solve close
              to the same problem. None has truly caught on in the industry,
              and their original sponsors have either stopped promoting or
              outright abandoned them.

              <br><br>

              FSL's immediate predecessor is the <a
                href="https://mariadb.com/bsl11/">Business Source License</a>
              (BSL or BUSL). BUSL's time-based approach is great, but the
              Additional Use Grant is a serious flaw, because it creates <a
                  href="https://blog.adamretter.org.uk/business-source-license-adoption/#how-is-the-bsl-being-used">too
              much variability</a>. Each implementation of the BUSL is
              essentially a new license, so compliance departments have to
              separately review every case, which greatly slows adoption. FSL
              is an evolved BUSL that (we hope) has a better chance of
              catching on.</dd>

						<dt>What can I do with FSL software?</dt>

            <dd>In plain English, you can do anything with FSL software except
              (for one year) use it to compete with its author. You can read
              it, learn from it, run it internally, modify it, and propose
              improvements back to the author. After one year it becomes Open
              Source software under Apache 2.0 or MIT.</dd>

            <dt>What's with the name?</dt>
            <dd>Meh, it's functional. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</dd>

            <dt>What's the backstory?</dt>
