          <h2>What?</h2>

          <p>The Functional Source License (FSL) is a permissive non-compete
          license that converts to Apache 2.0 or MIT after two years. It is
          designed for SaaS companies that value both user freedom and
          developer sustainability. FSL provides everything a developer needs
          to use and learn from your software without corporate <a

          <h2>FAQ</h2>

          <dl>
            <dt>Why?</dt>

            <dd>Many software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies wish to make the
              source code for their core products available under <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license">permissive</a>
              terms without the risk of corporate <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem">free-riding</a>.
              A standard license for this purpose makes it easier on both producers
              and consumers of such software.</dd>

            <dt>Why not Open Source?</dt>
            <dd>Open Source does not protect against free-riding.</dd>

            <dt>Why not open core?</dt>
            <dd>Open core is not permissive enough.</dd>

            <dt>Why not [some other alternative]?</dt>

            <dd>There have been many attempts over the decades to solve close
              to the same problem. None has truly caught on in the industry,
              and their original sponsors have either stopped promoting or
              outright abandoned them.

              <br><br>

              FSL's immediate predecessor is the <a
                href="https://mariadb.com/bsl11/">Business Source License</a>
              (BSL or BUSL). BSL's time-based approach is great, but the
              Additional Use Grant is a serious flaw, because it creates <a
                  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231106144534/https://blog.adamretter.org.uk/business-source-license-adoption/#how-is-the-bsl-being-used">too
              much variability</a>. Each BSL implementation is essentially a
              new license. Also, four years is too long. FSL is an evolved BSL
              that (we hope) has a better chance of catching on.</dd>

            <dt>What can I do with FSL software?</dt>

            <dd>You can do anything with FSL software except compete with its
              producer. You can read it, learn from it, run it internally, modify
              it, and propose improvements back to the producer. After two years
              it becomes Open Source software under Apache 2.0 or MIT.</dd>

            <dt>Why only Apache 2.0 and MIT?</dt>

            <dd>We started with popular licenses according to <a
                                                                 href="https://opensource.org/licenses/?categories=popular-strong-community">OSI</a>
              and <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">GitHub</a>. Copyleft
              is not our jam. BSD and ISC don't offer anything over
              MIT. That leaves Apache 2.0 (with its patent grant)
              and MIT.</dd>

            <dt>What's with the name?</dt>
            <dd>Meh, it's functional. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</dd>

            <dt>What's the backstory?</dt>
