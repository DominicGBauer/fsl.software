### Welcome!

This repo holds the source code for [fsl.software](https://fsl.software/), the
homepage for the [Functional Source License (FSL)](https://fsl.software/). If
you have questions or want to add your company logo, [open an
issue](https://github.com/getsentry/fsl.software/issues/new) or dive in
with a PR.


### Now What?

Also in this repo we are [brainstorming what might be
next](https://github.com/getsentry/fsl.software/issues/5) beyond FSL.
Here is some context to catch you up on the backstory and where we are headed.

> We want to do something about harmful free-riding by prioritizing developer
> sustainability—for ourselves and others—in addition to user freedom.

[Introducing the Functional Source License: Freedom without Free-riding](https://blog.sentry.io/introducing-the-functional-source-license-freedom-without-free-riding/)

> We value software freedom for users to an extent, but we don’t think of it in
> the same strident terms as the Free Software movement. We think of freedom
> primarily in terms of **access** to technology and knowledge to improve
> efficiency for developers. What’s more, it’s not the only thing that matters
> to us. We also value **sustainability** for developers. The two are often in
> tension. Finding and maintaining a good balance between them is what Open
> Source means to us.

[Sentry’s Open Source Values](https://blog.sentry.io/sentrys-open-source-values/)

> I think the way forward here is to make what I suspect is a loose
> confederation of folks using non-compete licenses to actually get together
> and draft their own set of values. To then brand that. And stand behind it
> proudly.
