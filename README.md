# A Loose Confederation

> I think the way forward here is to make what I suspect is a loose confederation of folks using non-compete licenses to actually get together and draft their own set of values. To then brand that. And stand behind it proudly.

> We value software freedom for users to an extent, but we donâ€™t think of it in the same strident terms as the Free Software movement. We think of freedom primarily in terms of **access** to technology and knowledge to improve efficiency for developers. Whatâ€™s more, itâ€™s not the only thing that matters to us. We also value **sustainability** for developers. The two are often in tension. Finding and maintaining a good balance between them is what Open Source means to us.

## First, a New License

We shipped [a new license](https://fsl.software/). ðŸ’ƒ

## Then ... What?

Beyond the new license, we're [brainstorming what might be next](https://github.com/getsentry/loose-confederation/issues/5).
